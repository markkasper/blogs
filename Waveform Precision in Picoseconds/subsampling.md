# Waveform Precision in Picoseconds: Subsampling Techniques with Zurich Instruments QCCS

This script implements an example sequence that sets the wait time between two pulses to sub-sample precision, as described in the blog post.

## Imports

```python
# Import what we need to get started:
from laboneq.simple import DeviceSetup, Session
from zhinst.toolkit import CommandTable, Sequence

from itertools import count
```

## Descriptor and Device Setup


Labone Q uses a descriptor file containing the list of intstruments to be used in an experiment. Edit the descriptor YAML to include your device's ID and include your IP address or `localhost` below when running this notebook on your own setup. You can read about the details of defining a descriptor here: https://docs.zhinst.com/labone_q_user_manual/concepts/set_up_equipment.html

```python
setup_descriptor = '''
instrument_list:
  #HDAWG:
  #- address: 'DEVXXXX'
  #  uid: device
  SHFQC:
  - address: 'DEVXXXXX'
    uid: device
connections:
  #device:
  #  - rf_signal: none/none
  #    ports: [SIGOUTS/0]
  device:
    - iq_signal: none/none
      ports: [SGCHANNELS/0/OUTPUT]
'''

# Define the DeviceSetup from descriptor - 
# Additionally include information on the dataserver used to connect to the instruments 
my_setup = DeviceSetup.from_descriptor(
    setup_descriptor,
    server_host='localhost',
    server_port='8004',
    setup_name='Setup_Name',
) 

# The target AWG in the instrument
AWG_CORE_INDEX = 0
```

## Session


We etablish a connection to the device with the `Session` class.

```python
# Connect to the Session
my_session = Session(device_setup=my_setup)
my_session.connect(do_emulation=False) # Note: Emulation is not supported when using the Toolkit!
```

### Accessing Device Nodes


We make the following assignments and definitions to access the nodes using the Toolkit from within LabOne Q. In a LabOne Q Session, each device that has been connected to can be accessed using its device ID.

```python
instrument_serial = my_setup.instrument_by_uid('device').address
device = my_session.devices[instrument_serial]
```

```python
#Detect the device type
if device.device_type.startswith('SHFSG') or device.device_type.startswith('SHFQC'):
    device_type = 'sg'
elif device.device_type.startswith('HDAWG'):
    device_type = 'hd'
else:
    raise RuntimeError('Unsupported device for this experiment')

#Fetch the AWG and channel nodes
if device_type == 'sg':
    awg = sgchannel.awg
    sgchannel = device.sgchannels[AWG_CORE_INDEX]
elif device_type == 'hd':
    awg = device.awgs[AWG_CORE_INDEX]
    out_ch = [2*AWG_CORE_INDEX, 2*AWG_CORE_INDEX+1]
```

### Reset to a Default State


If you'd like to reset your device, turn off all ouputs, and revert to the default state, you can uncomment the reset command below. Note that while the HDAWG supports this functionality, some other Zurich Instruments products do not.

```python
# Reset the device to its factory settings before beginning tutorial
#device.factory_reset()
```

## Apply Instrument Settings


We use a transactional set to simultaneously push all of our desired settings to the HDAWG:

```python
# use transactional set to configure multiple settings
with device.set_transaction():
    if device_type == 'sg':
        awg.single(True)                                          # Disable 'Rerun' of AWG sequencer
        awg.modulation.enable(False)                              # No modulation
        awg.outputamplitude(0.5)                                  # Amplitude to 0.5 to not saturate the output
        awg.outputs[0].gains[0](1.0)                              # Set the correct output gain

        sgchannel.marker.source('output0_marker0')                # Set the marker output

        sgchannel.digitalmixer.centerfreq(0.0)                    # No modulation
        sgchannel.output.rflfpath('lf')                           # Use LF path
        sgchannel.output.range(0.0)                               # 0 dBm range
        sgchannel.output.on(True)                                 # Switch ON the output

    elif device_type == 'hd':
        device.system.awg.channelgrouping(0)                      # work in non-grouped mode (individual AWG cores)

        awg.single(True)                                          # Disable 'Rerun' of AWG sequencer
        awg.outputs['*'].modulation.mode('off')                   # Disable digital modulation
        awg.outputs[[0,1]].gains[[0,1]](1.0)                      # Sets the Waveform Generator output amplitude

        device.triggers.out[out_ch[0]].source('output0_marker0')  # Set the marker output

        device.sigouts[out_ch].range(1.0)                         # Set output voltage range
        device.sigouts[out_ch].on(True)                           # Switch on the outputs
```

## Pulse Sequence


We now define our pulse, subsampling, and sample parameters. In the previous blog post, we shifted waveforms by one sample. Here, we retain the ability to utilize that single sample precision, and we add the functionality to control the spacing of our waveform by less than a sample!

```python
# Sequencer program for the AWG
seq = Sequence()
seq.constants['LEN_SECTION'] = 1024

# Waveform paramaters
seq.constants['PULSE_WIDTH'] = 1e-9 #ns
seq.constants['SIGMAS_PULSE'] = 6

# Sequence parameters
seq.constants['SUBSAMPLING_BITS'] = 2  # Bits to use for subsampling
seq.constants['T_START'] = 0           # Start wait time, in subsamples units (one step is 1/((2**SUBSAMPLING_BITS)*SAMPLE_RATE) second)
seq.constants['T_END'] = 320           # Stop wait time
seq.constants['T_STEP'] = 1            # Step wait time
seq.constants['SAMPLE_STEPS'] = 16     # Sample precise steps, given by the AWG granularity

#Readout parameters
seq.constants['TRIGGER_LEN'] = 32
seq.constants['READOUT_LEN'] = 1024

#Waveforms index
NUM_SHIFTED_ENTRIES = seq.constants['SAMPLE_STEPS'] * 2**seq.constants['SUBSAMPLING_BITS']
wfm_index = count(NUM_SHIFTED_ENTRIES)
seq.constants['WAVE_FIRST_INDEX'] = next(wfm_index)
seq.constants['TRG_INDEX'] = next(wfm_index)

#Command table parameters
ct_index = count(NUM_SHIFTED_ENTRIES)
seq.constants['TE_FIRST_PULSE'] = next(ct_index)
seq.constants['TE_READOUT_TRG'] = next(ct_index)

# Creation of the command table
ct = CommandTable(awg.commandtable.load_validation_schema())
# - Define all the shifted pulses
for i in range(NUM_SHIFTED_ENTRIES):
    ct.table[i].waveform.index = i

# - Plays the first pulse edge
te_first_pulse = ct.table[seq.constants['TE_FIRST_PULSE']]
te_first_pulse.waveform.index = seq.constants['WAVE_FIRST_INDEX']

# - Triggers the readout
te_readout_trg = ct.table[seq.constants['TE_READOUT_TRG']]
te_readout_trg.waveform.index = seq.constants['TRG_INDEX']

# Definition of the sequence to be uploaded to the device
seq.code = '''\

  }
}

//Assign index and outputs
assignWaveIndex(1, pulse0, WAVE_FIRST_INDEX);
assignWaveIndex(trigger, TRG_INDEX);
